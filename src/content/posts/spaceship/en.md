We could sign up to ride a spaceship into space. Everyone around me had signed up ages ago, buzzing with excitement, but I never had much interest. Then, right before the deadline, I suddenly decided to register.

The staff member said he hoped I had taken a course on spaceflight basics back in primary or middle school. I said I hadn't. He said, well, if you haven't, there could be accidents during the flight, and you'd have to accept the consequences yourself. I said, sure, fine.

Then I woke up.
