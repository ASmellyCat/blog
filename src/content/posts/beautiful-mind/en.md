Had a session with my counsellor today.

Somewhere in the middle of the conversation, she stopped and said — you have a beautiful mind. She told me I'm a deeply authentic person, genuinely sincere. She said I use humour and sarcasm to deflect the heavy things, but she could see what was underneath. She said I actually love myself. She said she'd learned a lot from me.

I nearly cried. Then felt a little embarrassed.

That's it.
