They met in high school.

Two people so quiet they were nearly transparent, tucked into the corners of the classroom like trees pruned too aggressively, trying to compress themselves into permissible shapes. Back then, nobody called it depression. Teachers called it antisocial. Parents called it a disappointment. Classmates just called it weird.

They never really talked about each other's wounds. They didn't need to.

They would walk up to the rooftop together. Say nothing, just sit, watching the city unfurl beneath their feet. The wind came from somewhere far away.

One day, he saw her get called into the teacher's office. Through the glass window, he saw the teacher's hand slip under her skirt. He saw her head bowed, her shoulders trembling faintly. He stood in the hallway, fists clenched.

When she came out, he was just standing there. Neither of them said a word. They walked side by side down the corridor, across the schoolyard, up to the rooftop. The wind was strong, whipping their uniforms into sharp snaps against the air.

Later, they went to the rooftop again. It was pouring that day. Raindrops hammered the concrete, dense and relentless, like someone far away was knocking on a door that had been shut for a very long time. She pulled out a voice recorder, pressed the button, and held it out toward the curtain of rain for a long while.

On the way downstairs, she pressed the recorder into his hand.

"For you."

He didn't ask why. He took it and slipped it into his pocket.

They went to different universities. She went to Chongqing. He went to Kunming. Two cities soaked in rain. She listened to the rain by the Jialing River; he listened by Green Lake. They kept in touch now and then — a message here, sometimes just a photo of a rainy day.

Later, they each left the country. She went to London. He came to Vancouver. Two cities famous for their grey, endless rain. The drawn-out rainy seasons were like a rope stretched across the Pacific, loosely tying something together. Late at night he would often take out that voice recorder and listen to the rain from the high school rooftop. Over a decade old now, the sound had gone fuzzy, but the rain was still the same rain.

One day, she sent him a long voice message.

She said she'd been to Nepal, hiked Annapurna. She said the mountain in the rain was beautiful beyond this world — clouds surging up from the valley, swallowing everything whole, then slowly releasing it again. She said she'd recorded the sound of rain at the summit. Said she felt, in that moment, a profound stillness — so still she could almost forgive everything.

He sat in his Vancouver apartment and listened to the entire message. Outside his window, it was raining too. He wanted to say something back, thought about it for a long time, and in the end sent only a period. She would understand.

That was the last time she ever reached out.

He heard she'd moved to Sydney. Sydney doesn't get much rain. The sunlight there is fierce, the sky bleached white-blue, like a city scrubbed clean of all traces. He heard she had someone new, someone who lifted her out of her weathered old life and made it bright again. He thought: maybe she'd finally walked to a place where the rain had stopped. Maybe her world finally had a sound worth remembering without a recorder.

The person standing in the sunlight was not him. He thought about this, and decided it was fine. Then he thought about it some more, and decided it wasn't entirely fine.

Then one day, he saw her name in the news. Suicide.

He stared at the screen for a long time, so long that it dimmed itself to black. He didn't cry. He just felt something in his chest cave in. Quietly. Slowly. Like a house no one had lived in for years finally admitting it was a ruin.

The sunlight in Sydney was so good. Someone loved her so fiercely. She had already come so far.

But maybe some things, once shattered early enough, can never truly be pieced back together. No matter how hard the people who came after tried, no matter how clear the skies of the cities that followed. The fragments had already embedded themselves in her bones, grown into her, become part of who she was.

He bought a plane ticket, flew to Kathmandu, shouldered a pack, and set out on the trail she had once walked.

Near the summit, the rain came down in torrents.

Water streamed down his face. He couldn't tell if it was rain, sweat, or something else. He thought of her on the rooftop holding up the recorder, of her by the Jialing River photographing the rain, of her on the summit of Annapurna saying "I feel so still." And of her, in the end, walking into the Sydney sunlight and never walking back out.

He stood at the summit. Stood there for a very long time.

The rain didn't stop. Clouds surged up from the valley, swallowed him, then released him again. Exactly as she had described. But he knew — they stood in the same place and saw completely different things.

He began his descent.

Before he left, he placed the voice recorder on a stone at the summit.

He walked down the mountain.

The rain continued to fall.
