description: "A dream about doors that open inward."

I was walking through a corridor that stretched longer than it should have. The walls were the color of old paper — not white, not yellow, something in between. Every few steps, there was a door.

The doors were all identical: dark wood, brass handles, no numbers. But I knew — the way you know things in dreams, without evidence — that each one led somewhere completely different.

I opened the first. Behind it: a room full of clocks, all showing different times, all ticking at different speeds. The sound was overwhelming, so I closed it quickly.

The second door opened onto a rooftop. Not a building I recognized, but the city below felt familiar. The sky was that impossible shade of violet that only exists in the last frame before waking.

I didn't open the third door. Something about it felt final. I pressed my palm against the wood and felt warmth, like sunlight on the other side.

Then I was awake. The corridor already fading, the doors closing one by one, taking their secrets with them.
