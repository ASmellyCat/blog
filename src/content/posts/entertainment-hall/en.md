It was raining. My two friends and I pushed open the door of a dimly lit, lavishly decorated entertainment hall. Inside, the place was buzzing — tables crammed together, one after another, like a party that would never end.

I went upstairs to look around and came back down. Friend B leaned in and told me: a girl had just called the front desk asking if her boyfriend was here with someone else, renting a room. The receptionist flatly denied it, but somehow the girl still tracked the place down and even took a photo of us in the main hall. I laughed when I heard this. A place like this, and they have rooms?

Curiosity got the better of us. We decided to explore.

After winding through one corridor after another, we found a hidden door. Behind it, a long hallway stretched into deepening darkness. At the end, the space suddenly opened up — a hollow square structure, four storeys tall, with rooms packed tightly along every level like a honeycomb.

Then we saw what we were never meant to see.

Many of the doors were wide open. Inside, girls lay on beds, sobbing quietly. Their legs had been broken. They couldn't leave. We froze in place, and it finally clicked — that boyfriend was never sneaking around for an affair. He was doing something far more cruel than betrayal.

We turned and ran. A bolted out first, but B suddenly stopped, turned back toward the main hall, rushed up to a table, and screamed at a silent man sitting there: How can something like this exist? The man stared back at her without a word. I grabbed B's arm and hissed: Stop talking, please, let's go. If they find out we saw this, we won't make it out either.

As we sprinted for the exit, a thought struck me like lightning: A had left ahead of us — could they have already caught her?

I dragged B all the way home.

At the front door, my hands were shaking as I fumbled through a thick ring of keys, trying them one by one. None of them worked. My hands wouldn't stop trembling. Then B reached into her pocket, pulled out her key, and — click — the door opened.

A was sitting inside. Safe.

I exhaled.

A looked at me and said: You lost your key, you know that?

I said: How do you know?

She said: Someone told me.

I said: Who?

She said: The man.

My heart plunged into ice water. Out of all those keys, the one missing was mine. He has my key. He knows where I live.

In the middle of the night — will he come?

Cold sweat soaked through my back. Then I woke up.
