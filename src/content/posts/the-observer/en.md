She doesn't remember her mother's face.

All she remembers is her father. Her father's fists, her father's bottles, the sound of the entire wall shuddering whenever her father slammed the door. Childhood, for her, was not a chapter of life. It was a prolonged siege.

She learned silence. Silence was the safest posture. Don't cry, don't flinch, don't beg. Compress yourself into something that takes up no space, and maybe you won't be noticed. But rage cannot be crushed to death. It merely sinks somewhere deeper, growing teeth in the dark.

One night, the year she turned fourteen, her father came home drunk again. Everything played out the same as always — shattered bottle, cursing, fists. But this time, something inside her snapped. Not a bone. Something deeper. A string in a place that has no name.

When she stood up, she was no longer herself.

The angry persona had no name — only instinct. When it erupted, her strength doubled, and every blow carried fourteen years of accumulated hatred. But rage is never free. It burns everything, including the one who wields it. In that state, her sensitivity to pain also doubled — every wound felt as though it were being torn open twice. Rage turned her into a double-edged sword, cleaving others while ripping herself apart.

By the time she "woke up," her father was on the floor. He never got up again. She was covered in wounds, unable to tell which ones he had caused and which she had inflicted on herself.

After the authorities intervened, a psychological evaluation revealed severe dissociative identity disorder. Given her age and mental state, she wasn't sent to prison. She was transferred to a neuroscience research centre under the state. The official explanation: "treatment and rehabilitation." What they really wanted was to fuse her two personalities — to make the angry shadow disappear forever.

The fusion experiments began.

But what the scientists hadn't anticipated was that, in the process of trying to suppress the rage persona, they accidentally awakened a third state. They called it "Silence."

In the state of Silence, her emotions dropped to absolute zero. Her consciousness became a lake of perfect stillness — any external stimulus that fell into it left no ripple. Unlike rage, Silence did not burn. It accumulated. Her inner energy condensed continuously in that extreme calm, like a silent dam brimming with potential. She could do more, endure more, release more. Not because she was stronger, but because she no longer wasted a single shred of energy on emotion. Every ounce was channelled precisely into action.

This is the fundamental difference between rage and stillness. Rage is a wildfire — it burns ferociously but consumes itself. Stillness is deep water — motionless on the surface, but beneath it, an inexhaustible current surges.

The research team went out of their minds with excitement. They had never encountered a case like this.

So the experiments continued. Deeper. Further. More dangerous.

They opened a fourth door.

They called it "Divinity."

In this state, she no longer merely suppressed or accumulated. She transcended. The power of all her personas converged in a single moment — the explosive force of rage, the endurance of stillness, and something else that no science could name. Her bodily functions breached the known limits of human capability, as if consciousness itself were vibrating at a different frequency. One researcher wrote a single line in the observation log: **"The way she looks at us — it's how a god looks at ants."**

But she had never asked for any of this.

She was just a child who had killed her father and wanted to be healed. They turned her into a specimen — a soul locked in a sterile room, disassembled and reassembled over and over. Every personality shift was recorded, analysed, quantified. Her suffering was data. Her existence was a sample.

Until one day, in the state of Silence, she calmly dismantled the laboratory's access control system. No rage, no violence. She simply removed every obstacle between herself and the exit, the way one solves a maths problem.

By the time the alarms went off, she was already standing on the roof of the research centre.

Behind her came the security guards and panicked scientists, weapons raised, shouting at her.

She didn't look back. The wind swept in, lifting the edge of her clothes.

She closed her eyes. In the darkness, all four personas existed at once: the silent child, the raging beast, the still lake, the merciless god. For the first time, they were not fighting for control. They simply coexisted, quiet, for a single moment.

She opened her eyes and leapt into the night.

No one knows where she went. In the research centre's files, her codename was reduced to two words:

**The Observer.**
