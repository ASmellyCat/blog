Some ideas don't arrive through the front door. They slip in through a crack in the window, settle into the corner of a room you forgot existed, and wait.

I've been thinking about the architecture of inspiration — how certain concepts seem to have a shape before they have words. A melody before lyrics. A silhouette before a face.

The best ideas feel less like inventions and more like discoveries. As if they were always there, buried under layers of noise, waiting for the right moment of silence.

Maybe that's why they come at odd hours. In the shower. On a walk. In that liminal space between sleep and waking, where the mind finally loosens its grip on the practical and lets the impractical through.

The trick, I think, is not to grab too tightly. Hold the idea gently, like water in cupped hands. Let it find its own shape.
