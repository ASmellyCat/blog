Are humans born good or born evil?

At first I chose evil without hesitation. The reasoning was simple: babies don't need anyone to teach them — they instinctively grab, bite, and scream until everyone around them gives in. Kindness is a trained behaviour, a product of socialisation, not some innate gift. Civilisation is not the expression of human nature; it is its cage.

But I immediately thought of a counterargument: if humans are rotten to the core, why would we build our own cages to lock ourselves in?

Evil people don't forge their own chains.

That thought caught me.

So I tried to defend the "born evil" side. Guilt, I argued, is not evidence of goodness — it's a product of conditioning. From childhood we're told over and over that stealing is wrong, lying is bad, hurting others demands an apology. These rules are carved into the brain like Pavlov's bell. Of all those people weeping in confessionals, how many are truly grieving the harm they caused, and how many are just afraid of getting caught, afraid of punishment, afraid of losing their reputation?

Guilt is self-preservation, not virtue. The thing humans do best is dressing up selfishness as morality.

But then I thought of this: a two-year-old, not yet trained by any moral system, sees their mother crying and reaches out to touch her face. No one taught them "you should comfort people when they cry" — they can't even say the word "should" yet. That isn't Pavlov's bell. That is something that exists before any rules do.

And then I noticed something even more interesting: hypocrisy is itself proof that goodness exists. Nobody pretends to be evil to win social approval. Everyone pretends to be good. If human nature were truly evil, then cruelty should be the currency of social life. But the reality is exactly the opposite — kindness is the default passport.

That's when a third possibility surfaced.

Maybe morality is neither proof that we're born good nor a correction for being born bad. Morality is an invention.

Thomas Hobbes wrote in *Leviathan* that the natural state of man is "a war of all against all." Everyone has the power to harm others, and everyone is vulnerable to being harmed. In such a state, no one is safe and everyone's interests are constantly degraded. So humans struck a deal: I give up some of my freedom to hurt you, you give up some of your freedom to hurt me, and we all surrender certain rights to a shared set of rules so that everyone's interests can be maximised.

This is social contract theory. Morality didn't fall from the sky. It wasn't bestowed by God, nor did it radiate from some inner light of the human soul. Morality is a game-theoretic equilibrium — the point a bunch of selfish creatures reached after hurting each other over and over, when they finally did the maths and realised: cooperation pays better than conflict.

From this angle, goodness isn't an instinct. It's a strategy. The optimal solution evolved through countless generations of trial and error. The individuals who refused to cooperate were eliminated — not because they were "bad," but because their strategy was inefficient in the long game.

So what is the essence of morality? It is a tool humans invented to coexist in relative peace. It doesn't prove we're inherently good, nor that we're inherently evil. It only proves we're clever enough to tame our own chaos with rules.

Back to the original question, then. Born good or born evil?

My answer: born chaotic.

Humans come into the world as a tangle of contradictions. Good and evil ship together, sharing the same body, waiting for the environment to activate one side or the other. Morality is the operating system installed after the fact, just enough to keep the mess from self-destructing. But the OS is not the hardware. Uninstall it, and that jumbled mess underneath is still there.

This answer isn't elegant. It isn't certain. But it's the most honest one I have right now.

Maybe admitting "I don't know" takes its own kind of courage. Most people would rather dig in on a wrong position than confess they've been swayed by their own argument.
